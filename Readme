## 🧠 Approaches Compared

- **Custom Implementation**: Simulated Annealing (SA)  
- **Auto-Sklearn**: Meta-Learning  
- **TPOT**: Genetic Algorithm  

**Constraints for Fair Comparison:**  
- Same preprocessing (one-hot, mean imputation, min-max scaling)  
- Same algorithm search space (scikit-learn models)  
- Same runtime (1 hour)

---

## ⚙️ Model Search Space

- Epsilon-Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest (RF)  
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

---

## 📏 Evaluation Metric

**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{\text{true}} - y_{\text{pred}})^2}
\]

- Measures average error  
- Lower is better; scale-dependent  

---

## 🔬 Simulated Annealing (SA)

- Optimization algorithm to find global optima  
- Accepts worse solutions probabilistically  
- Temperature decreases gradually to reduce randomness  
- Terminates when temperature < threshold or search space exhausted  

---

## 🛠 Implementation Overview

- `SimulationAnnealingPoly`: Runs SA for all algorithms  
- `SimulationAnnealingMono`: Core SA logic for one algorithm  
- `ProcessLogger`: Logs changes and progress  
- `DataModel`: Handles preprocessing and data splits  

---

## 🔧 Temperature & Cooling

**Initial & Final Temperature:**  
Based on expected difference in solution quality and acceptance probability.

**Cooling Ratio:**  
Depends on runtime budget and evaluation cost:  
\[
r = \left(\frac{T_{\text{final}}}{T_{\text{init}}}\right)^{1 / \text{updates}}
\]

---

## ⛔ Termination Criteria

- Final temperature threshold  
- Excessive repetition of known solutions (>10% of space)  
- Fully explored search space

## 📌 Model Insights

| Algorithm | Works Best When...          |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| SVR       | Many features               |
| SGD       | Rarely works well           |
| KNN       | Few features                |
| RF        | Most datasets               |
| MLP       | Most datasets               |

---

## 📉 Search Behavior

- RMSE reduces and stabilizes over iterations  
- More randomness early, more precision later  

---

## ⏱️ Runtime Notes

- Target runtime: 1 hour (12 min × 5 algorithms)  
- Real runtime varies by feature count and hyperparams  

**System:** Intel i7 (16 Cores), Windows 11, Python 3.10+
